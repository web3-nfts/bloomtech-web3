#   40. Invalid asm.js or Constructor Deprecation Warning

- In terminal run `node compile.js`

In the upcoming lecture, we will be logging the compilation of our script to the terminal. If you are using **solc 0.4.17** as shown in the course, you may get these warnings:

*Invalid asm.js: Invalid member of stdlib*

or

*':6:5: Warning: Defining constructors as functions with the same name as the contract is deprecated. Use "constructor(...) { ... }" instead.\n' +*

'    function Inbox(string initialMessage) public {\n' +

'    ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).\n'

**These specific warnings can be ignored as they will not cause any issues with the compilation or deployment of the contract we are building.**
